### Botw Freecam [[github]](https://github.com/tayydev/botw-freecam)

I developed and maintain a fork of etra0's [fantastic custom camera](https://github.com/etra0/botw-freecam) for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
I learned a bit of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to take the core tools that he built, and then adapt them to better serve my needs.

## A video that I produced using my modified camera tools

I was really motivated to work on this because the existing tools were _so close_ to what I was looking for, but lacking a few deal-breaker features like editable paths and save states.
I didn't have any knowledge of Rust at the time, but it was a great opportunity to dive in and see what I could figure out.

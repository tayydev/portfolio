### AI Bot
The 'AI Bot' is a Discord bot built using fine-tuned [GPT-2 models](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models) to create AI conversations that mimic human chat messages.
The project was my first time developing with the [Gradle](https://gradle.org)  build tool, and my first time working with a [Reactive Java Library](https://discord4j.com).

I learned how to set up a basic SQLite database, and spent a lot of time optimizing and managing the massive computation load that the AI generation required.

### Spycam [[website]](https://spycambot.net) [[library github]](https://github.com/tayydev/Riot4J)
Spycam is a [Discord](https://discord.com) bot built using my own [open source wrapper](https://github.com/tayydev/Riot4J) of Riot Games' REST API to synthesize data from [VALORANT](https://playvalorant.com) (a competitive first-person shooter).
For example, Spycam can send a notification in a text channel when a user completes a match, or help them track their current win-streak.
Spycam uses an OAuth flow to authenticate with players' Riot Accounts and the backend runs on Google Cloud managed with Docker. Monitoring is done with self-hosted Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki.

As the sole person behind this project I have prototyped the product, pitched/communicated with Riot Games for production API access, designed the server backend, and implemented all code.

Spycam is currently used in over 1000 Discord servers and has been featured by  [IGN India](https://in.ign.com/valorant/170592/news/this-fan-made-valorant-discord-bot-is-something-you-need-to-get-right-now).

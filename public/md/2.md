### Chess3
Chess3 is an original networked multiplayer turn-based strategy game built in [Unity](https://unity.com/) with C#.
Chess3 is a collaborative effort that is seeing active development.
I manage the project and serve as our lead engineer.
The project is organized on a private GitHub repository, and we use issues/branches extensively to manage the concurrent work of four contributors.

This is a great exercise in API design, and a chance to let other people interact with my code.
Setting up (and teaching my friends how to use) source control for this is a fantastic opportunity to practice working as a team.

    <h3>Spycam <a href="https://spycambot.net">[website]</a> <a href="https://github.com/NathanNorth/Riot4J">[library github]</a></h3>
    <div class="accent-line"></div>
    <p>
        Spycam is a <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> bot built using my own <a href="https://github.com/NathanNorth/Riot4J"> open source wrapper</a> of Riot Games' REST API to synthesize data from <a href="https://playvalorant.com">VALORANT</a> (a competitive first-person shooter).
        For example, Spycam can send a notification in a text channel when a user completes a match, or help them track their current win-streak.
        Spycam uses an OAuth flow to authenticate with players' Riot Accounts and the backend runs on Google Cloud managed with Docker. Monitoring is done with self-hosted Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki.

    <p>
        As the sole person behind this project I have prototyped the product, pitched/communicated with Riot Games for production API access, designed the server backend, and implemented all code.
        <br><br>
        Spycam is currently used in over 1000 Discord servers and has been featured by <a href="https://in.ign.com/valorant/170592/news/this-fan-made-valorant-discord-bot-is-something-you-need-to-get-right-now">IGN India</a>.

    <h3>Chess3</h3>
    <div class="accent-line"></div>
    <p>
        Chess3 is an original networked multiplayer turn-based strategy game built in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> with C#.
        Chess3 is a collaborative effort that is seeing active development.
        I manage the project and serve as our lead engineer.
        The project is organized on a private GitHub repository, and we use issues/branches extensively to manage the concurrent work of four contributors.

    <p>
        This is a great exercise in API design, and a chance to let other people interact with my code.
        Setting up (and teaching my friends how to use) source control for this is a fantastic opportunity to practice working as a team.

    <h3>GifHaven <a href="https://github.com/NathanNorth/GifHaven">[github]</a></h3>
    <div class="accent-line"></div>
    <p>
        GifHaven is a WIP tool for finding, saving, storing, and aggregating gifs.
        GifHaven is being built with <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> and is serving as a way for me to get my hands dirty with more interactive web design.
    </p>

    <div class="desc">This screenshot shows off basic <a href="https://tenor.com/">Tenor</a> search functionality, as well as some very in-progress CSS</div>
    <p>
        One of the most rewarding parts about GifHaven is that I get the "behind the curtain" experience where I choose how much customization and control I want to expose to the user.
        Right now I'm focused on creating a flexible core framework that transparently communicates to users how their data is stored.

    <h3>AI Bot</h3>
    <div class="accent-line"></div>
    <p>
        The 'AI Bot' is a Discord bot built using fine-tuned <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2 models</a> to create AI conversations that mimic human chat messages.
        The project was my first time developing with the <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> build tool, and my first time working with a <a href="https://discord4j.com/">Reactive Java Library</a>.
    </p>
    <img src="imgibot_generation_example.png" alt="Spycam Logo" class="graphic">
    <div class="desc">Output from the bot is <i>humorous</i></div>
    <p>
        I learned how to set up a basic SQLite database, and spent a lot of time optimizing and managing the massive computation load that the AI generation required.

    <h3>BOTW Freecam <a href="https://github.com/NathanNorth/botw-freecam">[github]</a></h3>
    <div class="accent-line"></div>
    <p>
        I developed and maintain a fork of etra0's <a href="https://github.com/etra0/botw-freecam">fantastic custom camera</a> for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
        I learned a bit of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> to take the core tools that he built, and then adapt them to better serve my needs.

    <div class="desc">A video that I produced using my modified camera tools</div>
    <p>
        I was really motivated to work on this because the existing tools were <i>so close</i> to what I was looking for, but lacking a few deal-breaker features like editable paths and save states.
        I didn't have any knowledge of Rust at the time, but it was a great opportunity to dive in and see what I could figure out.
